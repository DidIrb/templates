# DID-IRB TEMPLATE

Hello, my name is Dida, a full stack developer. I enjoy converting my ideas to working prototypes, I am building this template to help me reduce the amount of code written.

This is just the Intro to the template repository, developing solutions from scratch sometimes is a pain and this repository contains a list of templates, I will focus mostly on javascript frameworks.

These are the templates I am going to create

- [ ] next-js-mysql
- [ ] angular-express-mysql
- [ ] node-express-refresh-token-mysql
- [ ] node-sequelize-refresh-token-mysql
- [ ] react-native
- [ ] spring-boot-refresh-token-mysql

This is basically a repository for concepts that developers need to learn-so I will also include, tutorials of:

- Deploying Solutions
- Dockerisation and orchestrations
- Continous integration and deployment
- Gitlab-intro

## How to use:

The repository contains multiple branches - each branch has a separate history and are thus unrelated. This means you cannot merge them.

create a new branch with no history

    git checkout --orphan angular 

remove all files and folders

    git rm -rf * 

make an empty commit

    git commit --allow-empty -m "empty repo" 

To clone a branch use the command

    git clone --branch branch_name --single-branch https://github.com/DidIrb/templates.git

Feel free to correct and update this file
